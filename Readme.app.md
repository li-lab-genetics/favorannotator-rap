# FAVORannotator (DNAnexus Platform App)

FAVORannotator is a pipeline applet designed to functionally annotate genotype data in Genomic Data Structure (GDS) format of any genetic study using the FAVOR Database and create an annotated GDS (AGDS) file by storing the genotype data and their functional annotation data in an all-in-one file. The aGDS file can then facilitate a wide range of functionally-informed downstream analyses, for example, STAARpipeline. For more details about FAVORannotator, please see the step-by-step breakdown at https://github.com/xihaoli/STAARpipeline-Tutorial

This is the source code for an app that runs on the DNAnexus Platform.
